# Job Microservice

## Overview

The Job Microservice is designed to manage job listings, integrating with other microservices for company details and reviews. It provides RESTful endpoints to perform CRUD operations on job entities.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete job listings.
- **Integration**: Fetches company details from `COMPANY-SERVICE` and reviews from `REVIEW-SERVICE` via REST API.
- **Dynamic Data**: Uses RestTemplate for asynchronous integration of company and review data into job listings.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: For building the microservice.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Provides easy implementation of JPA-based repositories.
- **RestTemplate**: Handles HTTP requests to external services.
- **Java**: Programming language used for development.
- **JSON**: Data format for API communication.
- **Git**: Version control system for source code management.

## Setup

To run the Job Microservice locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven (for building and managing dependencies)
- MySQL or another compatible relational database

### Configuration

1. Clone the repository:
